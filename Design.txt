Managing the models in the game:
--------------------------------

- use a linked list for the models
- the list will be saved on the heap

- each model will have (each staruct essentially):

	- bounding_box_len (integer)			--> 2 bytes \
	- bounding_box_width (integer)			--> 2 bytes |\
	- top_left_x_position (integer) 		--> 2 bytes	| \  12 bytes total
	- top_left_y_position (integer)			--> 2 bytes	| /
	- pixel_layout (ptr to a pixel array)	--> 2 bytes	|/
	- pointer to the next object 			--> 2 bytes	/
	
- we will have a function that adds a node at the end:

	- using the malloc function to allocate 12 bytes (the size of the struct)
	- initialize the model pointer
	- initialize next to null (0)
	- x & y positions will be initialized in the function above 
	- length & width positions will be initialized in the function above 

Drawing order:
--------------
	save a copy of the map without moving models such as:

	- hp
	- bosses
	- player
	- projectiles

	when we move a model, we take a rectangle from the background first,
	draw it at the old location, and then drawing the model at the new location.

	the models draw order priority is (lowest to highest):
	
	1. bosses
	2. player
	3. projectiles
